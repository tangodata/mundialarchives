### ORGANIZATION

The Buenos Aires City’s Office of Festivals and Central Events of the Ministry of Culture will be the highest authority in the competition, with regard to the compliance of all the terms and conditions stated in these Rules. However, the organizing body of the PRELIMINARY will be the only one responsible for carrying out the event, in accordance with the letter agreement signed in due course and in each particular case with the Office of Festivals and Central Events. The organization of the PRELIMINARY may charge a fee to enter the competition, as well as to register in workshops or other scheduled activities. For this purpose, the Organizer will state, in the Annex I of these Rules, all information related to dates and ways to register, additional awards and mentions to the one established in the present Rules.

### REGISTRATION

To be eligible to register, dance partners must be 18 years of age by the start date of the local competition and must demonstrate a minimum of 3 (three) years of residence within the area of influence of the Preliminary, which is limited to Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Great Britain, Greece, Herzegovina, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Russia, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Vatican City.

No one will be allowed to register two or more times in the same category, but it will be possible in different ones, with the same or a different partner. If both members of the couple are natives or residents of different countries, they will have to choose the country of residence or birth of either one, as couples are allowed to represent only one country.

### CHECK-IN

In order to check in, all contestants must attend on the date and time specified by the Organization of the Preliminary, with their ID card. At this opportunity, they will receive the order number and be informed of the approximate dates and times on which they will perform in the different stages of the corresponding category.

Those who do not check in will not be able to participate in the championship. A delay will only be considered in duly proven cases of force majeure, except in the event of circumstances of public knowledge.

At the time of check-in, contestants will have to complete a form with their personal details, and with any other additional information required by the organization. On this form, they shall inform if they have had a work, professional or personal relationship with any of the members of the jury from the competition, in the last 180 days prior to the championship.

All the information provided at the time of check‐in will be considered a sworn statement. Any contradiction in the information, subsequent to the signature, shall be penalized by the Organization with the subtraction of points, disqualification from the competition, or any other resolution that this body may establish.

The ID and the registration form must be shown at every stage of the competition.

All championship contestants commit themselves to participate in various ceremonies and events planned by the Organization of the Preliminary—such as press conferences, interviews for radio stations and over‐the‐air or cable television channels, etc.—if they are summoned for such purpose.

### COMPETITION

The competition, in both categories, will be developed in 3 (three) stages: a) Qualifying Round, b) Semifinal, c) Final.

a) Qualifying Round: All registered couples will participate. They will dance twice (on the same or on a different day, according to the schedule established by the Organization)

b) Semifinal: Couples that have been selected in the Qualifying Round will participate.

c) Final: Couples that have been selected in the Semifinal will participate and also the champions of the different European Preliminaries of Tango BA.

In the Salon Tango category, couples will compete in group performances, dancing to three songs, recorded or played live, selected by the Organization.

In the Stage Tango category, each couple will compete individually, dancing to one song of their choice. The music piece shall not exceed (4) minutes and must be handed in to the Organization in digital format (two CD copies in good condition or mp3).

Since the jury will evaluate the variety of choreographies exhibited, it is recommended that participants perform different choreographies for each of the Qualifying rounds, although this is not exclusive.

The Organization will be entitled to eliminate from the competition those participants that:

a) Do not comply with the rules.
b) Commit any moral offense or improper act that tarnishes the image of the Championship or may cause displeasure in the public.

In order to ensure the impartiality and professional integrity of the jury members, contestants will not be able to participate in seminars, workshops and/or classes taught by any member of the jury, as long as they are in the competition.

### JURY

In both categories, the jury will be composed of a minimum of 4 (four) members, who— understanding and accepting the rules of the competition, and committing to their compliance— will determine the score of the participating couples. The juries will be appointed in accordance with the Office of Festivals, the Organization of the Preliminary and the Association of Teachers, Dancers and Choreographers of Argentine Tango (AMBCTA).

All the decisions of the jury will not be subject to appeal. By enrolling, participants accept this condition. In case of distrust or disagreement, participants may submit a written statement (in Spanish or English) to the Organization and NOT directly to the panel of evaluating judges. Any jury member who may have had a work relationship or been the teacher of any of the participants of the Preliminary for a period of at least 6 months close to the beginning of the competition, shall refrain from scoring such participant. For this purpose, both the voluntary statements of the jury and the information provided by participants when enrolling will be taken into account. In these cases, to get the couple’s final score, the judges’ scores will be added, and this amount will be divided by the number of jury members who actually voted.

The final score for each performance will result from the accumulation of points, given by each member of the jury on a scale of 1 to 10, in accordance with the criteria described in the following section.

The jury will choose a winning couple in each category. Also, the jury (with the agreement of the Organizer) may grant awards and special mentions to the second and third place, and will be entitled to award other mentions if deemed appropriate.

In exceptional cases (power interruption, incidents on stage, etc.), the jury may determine that contestants should dance to additional songs to arrive at a fair verdict. Participants may not refuse to perform.

In case of a tie, the couples with the same final score will have to break the draw, either by dancing an additional round in the salon tango category, or by performing a new choreography in the stage tango category, until a winning couple emerges from the votes of the jury.

### SUPERVISOR

Appointed by the Office of Festivals and Central Events, the Supervisor will bear the responsibility of ensuring the compliance of the present Rules and properly solve any inconvenience not considered in these Rules and establish or inform about the clarifying or interpretative rules that he considers necessary.

### CONTEST

#### Salon Tango / Tango de pista (unrestricted entry, amateurs and professionals)

Once formed, the couple must not separate while the music is playing. For the position to be considered correct, the body of one of the members of the couple must be contained all the time by the arm of the other. It is understood that in certain figures, this may be flexible, but not throughout the duration of the dance.

All movements must be made within the space allowed by the couple’s embrace.

The Jury will take into account the couple’s musicality and walking style as fundamental to the score.

Within these parameters, the couple may perform any commonly used figures of “social” tango, including barridas (sweeps), sacadas al piso (drawn to the floor), enrosques (twists), etc.

Jumps, figures that involve losing the contact of both feet with the floor and all other choreographic possibilities typical of Stage Tango are completely forbidden.

As is typical in a dancehall, couples must constantly move counterclockwise and may not stay in the same part of the choreographic space as this would obstruct the circulation on the dance floor.

Outfits will not be taken into consideration during the judging process.

#### Stage Tango (unrestricted entry, amateurs and professionals)

Participants will be able to express their view of the Argentine tango dance. This means that couples will be allowed to perform movements, figures and applications that are not directly related to the traditional tango dance. But the choreography must include traditional elements of tango: figure eights, spins, long walks, voleos, hooks, and the “milonguero embrace.” Couples will be able to break the embrace and use techniques from other dance disciplines, as long as they are justified and enrich the performance of the dancer.

Aerial tricks and movements from other dance disciplines must not be excessive. This means that they must not exceed a third of the overall performance. The couple must include floor movement sequences throughout the whole stage floor.

Outfits will not be taken into consideration during the judging process.

If a technical problem should occur, the Jury will evaluate the repetition of the choreography at the end of the assigned performing time slot.

In case of having a problem with the choreography, the couple will decide whether to continue dancing or not, and the Jury will evaluate the manner and grace with which they solve the inconvenience; but the couple will not be allowed to repeat the performance.

The selected song cannot not be more than four (4) minutes long.

### FILMING AND PHOTOGRAPHING

The Organization of the Preliminary reserves the right to record all the stages of the Championship, by any means known or to be known—including but not limited to filming, recording, photographing, digitalization, etc.—by itself or third parties, in order to promote and advertise the event. The recorded material obtained will be exclusive property of the Organization of the Preliminary, who will have to turn a copy of it, as established by the Collaboration Agreement, to the Office of Festivals. By entering the Championship, participants explicitly and irrevocably authorize the use of the recorded material, without this suggesting—or implying—any compensation for any reason whatsoever by the Organization of the Preliminary and/or the Office of Festivals, in favor of any person or organization that claims entitlement to any right that may be
invoked. This clause also includes, without limitations, all photographic material published and/or made available for promotion, advertisement, etc.

### PRIZES

Each category of the PRELIMINARY OF TANGO BUENOS AIRES FESTIVAL AND DANCE WORLD CUP 2016 will have one winning couple, who will automatically qualify to compete at the TANGO BUENOS AIRES FESTIVAL AND DANCE WORLD CUP 2016, starting in the final rounds.
