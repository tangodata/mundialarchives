Championship Rules
Rules for the “Tango de Pista” (salon tango) and “Stage Tango” official categories (National-Official; for amateur and professional dancers)
Rules for the Stage Group Competition/Showcase Category
Rules for the Salon Tango Senior Category
Rules for the Milonga Category

    All participants must confirm their registration at the time of accreditation. The presentation of an identity document is mandatory to obtain accreditation. It will not be necessary that the two members of the couple submit for accreditation; it can be done by one of the members bringing both documents. Accreditations by third parties shall not be made.
    The Milonga category of the competition will consist of three stages divided in two days:
    A. The Qualifying Round: All registered couples must participate. Couples will dance one qualifying round on Saturday March 31.
    B. The Semifinals and Finals:
        If there are 20 or more couples registered at the competition, there will be both a Semifinal and a Final round on Sunday April 1.
        If there are 12 to 19 registered couples at the competition, the couples selected at the qualifying round will pass directly to the Finals (there will be no semifinal round) on Sunday.
        If there are 8 to 11 registered couples at the competition, all couples will be evaluated by the Jury both on Saturday and Sunday (there will be no elimination on Saturday and the Champions, 2nd and 3rd places will be announced after the Final round on Sunday).
        If there are less than 8 couples registered to compete at this category, all couples will be evaluated by the Jury both on Saturday and Sunday (there will be no elimination on Saturday), and there will be a unique title and recognition for “Best Milonga Couple 2018”.

Rules for the “So you think you can TANGO?” Category ***NEW***

This is an unofficial category open to amateur dancers only.  There are no residence restrictions.

    In this category, dancers must register individually as a leader or a follower*. Registration is on a first come, first served basis with a limit of 20 leaders and 20 followers. If at the end of the registration process there are uneven numbers of leaders and followers, the extra participants registered in any of the two roles will not be able to take part in the competition and therefore their fees will be refunded.
    Dancing couples will be the result of a random matching of leaders and followers that will take place straight at the dance floor. They will  compete in groups and dance a round of three songs previously selected by the Committee.
    Dancers will change partners through a draw system for each of the three songs.
    Competitors who compete in other categories as well as professional tango dancers cannot compete in this category.
    All participants must confirm their registration at the time of accreditation. The presentation of an identity document is mandatory to obtain accreditation.
    There will be one unique round with no elimination (no semi-final or final rounds) on Sunday April 1. If there are more than 10 leaders and 10 followers registered, the total amount of dancers participating will be divided in two groups of equal numbers of leaders and followers for an optimum evaluation process.
    All dancers  will be evaluated individually by the Jury Panel who will determine a unique winner for each role.
    A title and recognition will be granted for “Best Argentine Tango USA Leader 2018” and “Best Argentine Tango USA Follower 2018”.

* (As dancers must register individually choosing the role or the leader or the follower, there is a tiny slightly possibility you might dance with a same gender partner if a woman registers as a leader or a man as a follower).
