### TANGO DE PISTA/SALON TANGO (professional and amateurs)

__Tango de Pista__ is understood as a social dance, where the most important is the musicality, the embrace and the connection between the members of the couple.

In this category, couples will compete in groups, dancing to three pieces previously selected by the Committee.

1.    About the Position of Tango Dance:
    -     Once a couple forms a dance frame, the partners shall not separate as long as the music is playing. This means that they cannot break the embrace, which is considered as the Tango dance position.
    -    For the position to be considered correct, partners must constantly hold each other by means of the embrace. It is understood that, in certain figures, this may be flexible; but not throughout the entire piece of music.
    -    All movements shall be performed within the space allowed by the couple’s embrace.
2.    The Judges will give special relevance to musicality , couple´s connection,  elegant walking and the search for the couple´s personality.
3.    It is allowed to change the dynamics and the speed on the same tango.
4.    Within these guidelines, participants may perform any figure commonly used, including “barridas” (sweeps), “sacadas” (close to the floor), “enrosques” (twists) as well as some embellishments.
5.    “Ganchos” (hooks), “saltos” (jumps), “trepadas” (climbs) and any other  possibilities typically used in stage tango where both feet lose contact with the floor are completely excluded.
6.    Couples, as in a real dance hall, must constantly move counterclockwise without going backwards. They can perform one or two back steps if the movement requires it, though.
7.     Couples must avoid remaining in the same place for too long to allow the floor circulation. In the case of a couple staying more than two musical phrases on the same spot, making it difficult for the round to circulate, the jury will consider lower the score.
8.    In the case of a couple stopping the dynamic of the floor circulation, it is not allowed to overtake. Jurors may consider whether this round should dance an extra song to solve the problem.
