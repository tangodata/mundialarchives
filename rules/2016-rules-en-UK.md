## Rules 2016 TANGO UK CHAMPIONSHIP
http://uktangobuenosairesfestival.com/judging-criteria

### PISTA (SALON) TANGO

In this category, couples will compete in groups, dancing three pieces previously selected by the Committee.

1. About the Position of Tango Dance:

A. Once a couple forms a dance frame, the partners shall not separate as long as the music is playing. This means that they cannot break the embrace, which is considered as the Tango dance position.

B. For the position to be considered correct, partners must constantly hold each other by means of the embrace. It is understood that, in certain figures, this may be flexible; but not throughout the entire piece of music.

C. All movements shall be performed within the space allowed by the couple’s embrace.

2. The Judges will give special relevance to the couple’s musicality and connection, technique, music interpretation and elegant walking style.

3. Within these guidelines, participants may perform any figure commonly used, including barridas (sweeps), sacadas (close to the floor), enrosques (twists), etc.

4. Ganchos (hooks), saltos (jumps), trepadas (climbs) and any other typically stage tango possibilities where both feet lose contact with the floor are completely excluded.

5. Couples, as in a real dance hall, must constantly move counterclockwise and avoid remaining in the same place for too long to avoid the floor circulation.

6. None of the members of the couple may lift his/her legs beyond the line of the knees. Some foot embellishments are allowed within this limit.

7. Elegant social dance wear for women and traditional suits for men are advised although costumes will not be considered as a specific evaluation point in this category.

### STAGE TANGO

1. In the Stage Tango Category, each couple will compete individually, dancing to a choreographed song of their choice. It is better to use different pieces of music for the first and second parts of the Qualifying round; however, it’s possible to use the same piece and same choreography.

2. Length of a piece has to be less than 4:00 (four) minutes. Couples must prepare and submit a clean and good quality CD and/or pendrive that has 1-2 pieces of music (Tango only, no Milonga or Vals). All music must be recorded at the proper speed. Speed control will not be adjusted. Labels will be provided for music and must be attached to cd’s with the following information: couple’s name, song name and orchestra name. It is suggested that you bring a backup in case there is a problem with your master copy.

3. Participants will be able to express their personal view on the Tango dance: this means they may use movements, figures and applications that are not usually related to traditional Tango, however, the choreography must include traditional figures of Tango such as: ochos, long walks, boleos, ganchos, and also the “milonguero embrace”.

4. Couples may break the embrace and use techniques derived from other dance disciplines, as long as these are justified and performed for the benefit of the interpreter.

5. Aerial tricks and other movements characteristic of other dances must not be excessive, (this means that they must not exceed one third of the performance). The couple must perform displacement movement sequences onto the floor using the whole scenic space.

6. The Judges will take into account the following criteria:
A. Choreographic composition
B. Preservation of the Tango essence
C. Use of the stage space.
D. Choreographic and postural techniques
E. Body and space alignment.
F. Couple’s synchronicity
G. Choreographic effects
H. Music Interpretation
I. Musical accuracy
J. Tango costumes and make-up (use of inappropriate costumes that are not typically for performing tango such as salsa or ice skating costumes will be penalized)
