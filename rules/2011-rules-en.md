### CONTEST (EVALUATION CRITERIA)

#### 1. SALON TANGO (UNRESTRICTED ENTRY, AMATEURS AND PROFESSIONALS)

Once formed, the couple must not separate while the music is playing. This means that they will not be break the embrace, which is considered the basic dance position in tango. For the position to be considered correct, the body of one of the members of the couple must be contained all the time by the arm of the other. It is understood that in certain figures, this may be flexible, but not throughout the duration of the dance.

All movements must be made within the space allowed by the couple’s embrace.

The Jury will take into account the couple’s musicality and walking style as fundamental to the score.

Within these parameters, the couple may perform any commonly used figures, including barridas (sweeps), sacadas al piso (drawn to the floor), enrosques (twists), etc.

All other figures typical of Stage Tango such as ganchos (hooks), saltos (jumps) and trepadas (climbs) are completely forbidden.

Couples must constantly move counterclockwise and may not stay in the same part of the choreographic space as this would obstruct the circulation on the dance floor.

Neither member of the couple may lift his or her legs above the knees.

#### 2. STAGE TANGO (UNRESTRICTED ENTRY, AMATEURS AND PROFESSIONALS)

Participants will be able to express their view of the Argentine tango dance. This means that couples will be allowed to perform movements, figures and applications that are not directly related to the traditional tango dance. But, the choreography must include traditional elements of tango such as: figure eights, long walks, boleos, hooks, and the “milonguero embrace.” Couples will be able to break the embrace and use techniques from other dance disciplines, as long as they are justified and enrich the performance of the dancer.

Aerial tricks and movements from other dance disciplines must not be excessive. This means that they must not exceed a third of the overall performance. The couple must include floor movement sequences throughout the whole stage floor.

### PRIZES

Each category of the Dance World Cup 2011 will have a winning couple. The prize for the first place in each category will be THIRTY THOUSAND pesos (30,000). The second and third places will also receive prizes and special mentions. All contestants will obtain a Dance World Cup 2011 participation certificate.

The enrollment and subsequent registration of each couple implies the knowledge and acceptance of these Rules by each one of the participants of the Dance World Cup 2011.
