### THE JURY

The Jury of the Dance World Cup 2015 will be appointed by the Organization with the advice of eminent dance figures and the collaboration of the Association of Teachers, Dancers and Choreographers of Argentine Tango (AMBCTA) and the Chamber of Tango Venues and Argentine Popular Music. In both categories, the Jury will be composed of five members at the Qualifying Rounds, six at the Semifinals, and seven at the Final.

All the decisions of the Jury will not be subject to appeal. By enrolling, participants accept this condition.

The score for each performance will result from the accumulation of points, given by each member of the Jury on a scale of 1 to 10, in accordance with the criteria described in the following section. Then, an average score will be calculated by dividing the total points by the number of voting jury members.

Any jury member who may have had a work or personal relationship or been the teacher of any of the participants of the Championship for a period of at least six months close to the beginning of the competition, shall refrain from scoring such participant. For this purpose, both the voluntary statements of the jury members and the information provided by participants when enrolling will be taken into account. In these cases, the organization may opt for appointing a substitute jury member or getting the couple’s final score by dividing the amount of points received by the number of jury members who have actually voted.

The Jury will choose a winning couple for each category. Also, the Jury will grant awards and mentions to the second and third places and will be entitled to award other mentions if deemed appropriate.

In case of a tie for the first place, the contestants will dance to as many songs as necessary until a winning couple emerges from the votes of the Jury. Participants may not refuse to perform.

### SUPERVISOR

### CONTEST (EVALUATION CRITERIA)

#### 1. TANGO DE PISTA (SALON TANGO) (UNRESTRICTED ENTRY, AMATEURS AND PROFESSIONALS)

Tango de Pista (Salon Tango) is conceived as a social dance, where the most important aspects are the musicality, embrace and connection between the dance partners.

Once formed, the couple must not separate while the music is playing. For the position to be considered correct, the body of one of the members of the couple must be contained at all the time by the arm of the other. It is understood that in certain figures this may be flexible, but not throughout the whole duration of the dance. All movements must be made within the space allowed by the couple’s embrace, so as not to get in the way of the other couples dancing. The leader may invite the follower to walk and/or turn to their right or left, without taking steps backwards on the dance floor.

The Jury will take into account the couple’s connection, musicality, walking and search for their own expression as fundamental to the score.

Couples may change the dynamics and speed during a song.

Within these parameters, the couple may perform any commonly used figures of “social” tango, including barridas (sweeps), sacadas al piso (drawn to the floor), enrosques (twists), etc. Jumps, figures that involve lifting both feet off the ground and any other choreographic possibilities typical of Stage Tango are completely forbidden.

As is typical in a dancehall, couples must constantly move counterclockwise without going backwards. They will be allowed, if needed, to walk one or two step backwards at most.

If a couple performs more than two phrases in the same spot, obstructing the circulation on the dance floor, the Jury may consider lowering their score.

In the event that one couple stops the flow of traffic around the dance floor, it is not possible for other couples to go past them. If the jury deems it necessary, the round of couples may have to dance to another tango to solve the inconvenience.

Outfits will not be taken into consideration during the judging process. Partners do not need to break the embrace between songs.

#### 2. STAGE TANGO (UNRESTRICTED ENTRY, AMATEURS AND PROFESSIONALS)

Participants will be able to express their view of the Argentine tango dance. This means that couples will be allowed to perform movements, figures and applications that are not directly related to the traditional tango dance. But the choreography must include traditional elements of tango: figure eights, spins, long walks, voleos, hooks, and the “milonguero embrace.” Couples will be able to break the embrace and use techniques from other dance disciplines, as long as they are justified and enrich the performance of the dancer.

Aerial tricks and movements from other dance disciplines must not be excessive. This means that they must not exceed a third of the overall performance. The couple must include floor movement sequences throughout the whole stage floor.

Outfits will not be taken into consideration during the judging process.

If a technical problem should occur, the Jury will evaluate the repetition of the choreography at the end of the assigned performing time slot.

In case of having a problem with the choreography, the couple will decide whether to continue dancing or not, and the Jury will evaluate the manner and grace with which they solve the inconvenience; but the couple will not be allowed to repeat the performance.

### PRIZES

Each category of the Dance World Cup 2015 will have a winning couple. The prize for the first place in each category will be FORTY THOUSAND pesos ($40,000). The second and third places will also receive prizes and special mentions. All contestants will obtain a Dance World Cup 2015 participation certificate.

A couple’s registration and subsequent check-in implies the knowledge and acceptance of these Rules by each one of the participants of the Dance World Cup 2015.

The Organization will properly solve any inconvenience not considered in these Rules and establish or inform about the clarifying or interpretative rules that considers necessary.

In case of distrust or disagreement, participants may submit a written statement (in Spanish or English) to the Organization and not directly to the Jury, in accordance to the terms of the Law of Administrative Procedure (Dec. 1.510/97).

In case of controversy in the interpretation or implementation of these Rules, the participants and the Organization agree to be subjected to the jurisdiction of the Administrative Litigation and Tax Court of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. The parties hereby expressly renounce to any other venue or jurisdiction that may be applicable for any reason. For these purposes, the parties establish that their legal valid residence is the one indicated in the registration form. Any notifications shall be served upon such residence. Furthermore, any legal notification that may be served upon the G.C.A.B.A. (Buenos Aires Autonomous City Government) shall be sent to the following address: Uruguay 440, 2o piso, of. 27, in accordance with Executive order number 3.758/85 (B.M. number 17.540 - AD 280.4), Legal notice number 868/CSJN/87, and Executive order number 294/GCBA/97 (BOCBA number 168).
